# Enable UPI payment in your Android App. Know how to create custom Intent chooser with fix number of Android App and Show them in IOS like UI ActionSheet in your Android App.

For using UPI, There is no need to use payment gateway.Although gateway provide more fleibility and features. User can pay merchant using their existing UPI enabled Android App like Paytm, Freecahrge and Google pay.I have tested these above app and they return refNo or txtNo after payment.
